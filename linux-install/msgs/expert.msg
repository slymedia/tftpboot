The default method of installing 0cRed Hat07 Enterprise Linux uses 
autoprobing to automatically detect the hardware in your system.  Although 
most systems may be autoprobed without difficulties, in certain cases 
there can be problems.  It's possible to overcome these problems by 
using expert mode.

To start the installation using expert mode, type 0fexpert <ENTER>07.

While in expert mode, you will have complete control over the
installation process.  You will also be able to enter optional module
parameters while in expert mode.

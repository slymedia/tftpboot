The 0cRed Hat07 Enterprise Linux CD-ROM includes a rescue mode which can be 
used when a system does not boot properly.  The rescue mode includes many
useful utilities (editor, hard drive and RAID tools, etc.) which will allow
one to restore a system to a working state.

To enter the rescue mode, boot your system from the 
0cRed Hat07 Enterprise Linux CDROM and type 
0flinux rescue <ENTER>07.
